## Description

The Cocktail ordering app is designed to allow clients at the pub to see a list of cocktails available. This digitized system allows patrons to place their orders directly from the app, thus eliminating the need for them to come into contact with physical menus, which may be contaminated during disease outbreaks such as the one witnessed during the COVID-19 outbreak or even the common cold season. The app also makes the process of ordering drinks more efficient as patrons can complete this task through their phones.

## Client Requirements

The client for this project is "Moringa After 4 Pub", a tech-savvy establishment that aims to rejuvenate developers and satisfy their thirst after a day of coding. As the majority of their clientele consists of programmers, the owner decided to "speak their language" and digitize as many manual tasks as possible, starting with the cocktail menu.

## Setup Requirements

Since the app utilizes an online public API, no further installations are required. Once deployed online, all that a user will need is a device with internet access and browser. By simply clicking on the provided URL, they will be directed straight to the menu.

## Current Version

- Version: v1.0

- Description: This is the first version of a much larger final app, at this point the app aims to achieve:

             1. Cocktail List: The app will display a list of available cocktails available for order
             2. Ordering: The app allows users to easily order their desired drinks by simply clicking the order button, which populates the order list.

## Technologies Used (v1.0)

- HTML
- CSS
- javascript
- Adobe illustrator

## API (v1.0)

## Future Expansion

This is an ongoing project, not just of a cocktail ordering app, but also has the potential to become a national drinking statistics data collection tool and a lucrative advertising revenue generator. The developer has expressed interest in adding additional features to enhance its functionality, in later versions of the project. Some of the features being consiered for future implementation include:

    1.Drink Alert System: An alert system will be incorporated to calculate the number of drinks a patron has consumed during a single sitting. The system will issue warnings to the patron when they are approaching the legal "drink-drive" limit, triggering an alert after 3 drinks. After 5 drinks, the system will advise the patron to avoid driving and consider taking a cab. Furthermore, the app will discourage the user from ordering more drinks after the 8th drink.

    2.User Accounts: Each user will have a unique account, providing their demographic details such as age, weight, BMI, and existing medical conditions. These details will create unique user profiles accessible through individual log-in credentials. Privacy & anonymity might be important to some users, at this point, thus the system will generate a unique Identification numbers for each user and not share their names to the data base. This feature enables the app to track and aggregate the number of drinks a user has consumed in a month. If a user's drink intake exceeds the recommended limit for their demographic, the app will provide health advice regarding their drinking habits. Additionally, the app may recommend the user to seek medical assistance from professionals advertising on the app, such as doctors, psychologists, and nutritionists.

    3.Reporting to Government Authorities: By tracking monthly consumption for each user, the system can provide valuable statistics on alcohol consumption. These reports can be shared with relevant government authorities such as NACADA (National Authority for the Campaign Against Alcohol and Drug Abuse), NTSA (National Transport and Safety Authority), or the Ministry of Health. The app can recommend that all alcohol purchases, whether from liquor stores, bars, or restaurants, require users to use their unique account I.Ds and receive monthly reports on their drinking habits. This will enable the government to gather statistical data on alcohol consumption, discourage heavy drinkers through targeted campaigns, and potentially generate revenue from advertising.

    4.Advertising Opportunities: With mandatory account I.D usage for purchasing drinks, advertisers targeting this niche market can leverage the platform. Doctors, anti-drinking campaigners, and alcoholic beverage sellers can push their advertisements through the app, reaching a well-defined audience. Advertising revenue can be shared between the developers and the responsible government agency (e.g., NACADA, Ministry of Health, or NTSA) on a 50/50 basis.

    5.Statistical Data Revenue: Beverage sellers, ranging from large-scale companies such as Diageo, EBL, and Keroche Breweries to small-scale vendors like pubs, restaurants, and liquor stores, can purchase valuable statistical data from the app. This data includes demographic details, dates & times of purchase, and locations of their customers. This Valuable insights into their customer base, will allow them to make better informed decisions when planning their marketing & sales strategy thus optimize their operations.
